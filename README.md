# Devices of beehivemonitoring.com

This is a Documentation-project for the very good products of [beehivemonitoring.com](https://www.beehivemonitoring.com/). 
It will make you able to get the data from the products wether by reading the BLE (data from the products will be emitted by Bluetooth-Low-Energy-Protocoll) with an own BLE device (for example an ESP with [openmqttgateway](https://docs.openmqttgateway.com/) or via API from the data-website of beehivemonitoring.com.
